# TJShow show controller

## Build instructions

TJShow builds with Visual Studio 2008 Professional on Windows XP (newer versions of either should work, but are untested). Before building, install the DirectX 9.0 SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=6812) and check whether it is included in both the header as well as library search paths for the TJShow project.

Currently only the Release build works.
